# README - Flask APP

## Starting the Docker Container

To start the application using Docker, follow these steps:

### 1. Bring up the Docker container:
First, run the following command to start the container using Docker Compose and then run the following commands:
```bash
docker-compose up

# from different cli
docker exec -it slim-python bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

python data_transformation.py

```

Running data_transformation.py creates json objects from csv files, and then saves both of the 
json objects, and finally, it creates a careerhub db. Then imports 2 jsons into respective collections,
jobs_detailed and jobs_important. 

Then, run `python run-app-docker.py`. 

This will launch the flask app:
